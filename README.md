# Numierical Methods in Computational Engineering

Computational engineering has become asx essential as the knowledge of mathematics and physics. This repository will build over time a series of python notebooks intended to provide an overview of the numerical methods used to simulate flows, solid deformation, the motion of atoms, to optimize systems, to perform signal processing, to quantify uncertainty, etc... The objective is to help students gain an appreciation and understanding of the potential, limitations, challenges and pitfalls of computational engineering and ultimately become better, smarter users of commercial and open-source simulation and data analysis software.

If you have any suggeestion, or find a mistake or bug, feedback is always appreciated: ydubief@uvm.edu
